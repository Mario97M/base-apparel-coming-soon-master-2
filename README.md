#Fashion Store Email Submission Page

This project is a part of the upcoming fashion store website. The page allows visitors to submit their email addresses to stay up-to-date with announcements and upcoming launch deals.

##Technologies Used

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

The page is built with semantic HTML5 markup, styled with CSS3, and has form validation implemented via JavaScript.

##Features

The webpage features an email input field with a submit button. When the user enters an email and clicks on the submit button, the input is validated to ensure it is in the proper email format. If the input is not a valid email address, an error message is displayed, and the border of the input field turns red.

The page is also fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across different devices (mobiles, tablets, and desktops).
